Some examples of implementation of k Nearest Neighbors Classifier

In the iris_dataset_classification, The dataset is imported from sklearn, 130 of the samples are used for training and the rest for validation.
kNN classifies a test sample on the basis of votes from its 'k' nearest neighbors. The training samples are plot in an n-dimensional space (here, the RGB values of pixels are the dimensions), and the test sample is plot in the same space to identify its neighbors.
